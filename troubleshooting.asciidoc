= Troubleshooting the all-in-one origin Vagrant image

This document contains steps and information we hope you can send us if something goes wrong with your vm. The problem for us is that there are at least 3 places where things can go wrong:

* Communication between your local machine and the VM
* Networking inside the VM due to Vagrant rewriting of networking
* Actual start up problems with the different pieces of OpenShift

== Things to try before writing us

* If you just upgraded your box and start having problems we have found that the best way to upgrade is:
1. vagrant halt
2. vagrant destroy -f
3. rm -rf .vagrant (on windows delete the .vagrant dir)
4. rm Vagrantfile
5. vagrant init thesteve0/openshift-origin
6. (optional) edit the new Vagrantfile with changes you need, such as more memory
7. vagrant up
